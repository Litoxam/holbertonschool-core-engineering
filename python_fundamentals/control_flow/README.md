# Python_fundamentals - control_flow

This project is about how to manage and execute different code depending on conditions, loops, and logical conditions. This project focuses exclusively on control flow using: `if`, `elif`, `else`, comparaison operators, boolean logic, `while` loops, `for` loops with `range()`.

## Requirements
- Correction will run on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**
- Python version used for correction: **Python 3.8.x**
- Every Python file must start exactly with:
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```
- Every Python file must:
	- Be executable
	- End with a newline
	- Be PEP8 compliant (pycodestyle 2.14.0)
- No external librairies are allowed unless explicity requested
- No functions are allowed in this project
- No imports are allowed
- Outputmust match expected formatting exactly

## Usage
```bash
./positive_or_negative.py
```

## Learning Objectives
- Write conditional statements using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Use comparison and logical operators correctly
- Control repetition using `while` and `for` loops
- Reason about loop boundaries and iteration ranges
- Generate formatted output using numeric iteration
- Combine conditions and loops to produce deterministic output

## Scripts Descriptions
- [`positive_or_negative.py`](./positive_or_negative.py): Prints specific sentences depending on the sign of the generated number. This line is given for this exercice:
```python
number = __import__('random').randint(-10, 10)
```
- [`last_digit.py`](./last_digit.py): Prints specific sentences depending on the last digit of the generated number. THis line is given for this exercice:
```python
number = __import__('random').randint(-10000, 10000)
```
- [`print_alphabt.py`](./print_alphabt.py): Prints the lowercase except for `q` and `e`
- [`print_hexa.py`](./print_hexa.py): Prints numbers form 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal
	- Task requirements
		- We can only use **one** `print` function with string format
		- We can only use **one loop** in our code
		- We are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
- [`print_comb2.py`](./print_comb2.py): Prints numbers from 0 to 99 formatted as two-digit numbers separated by comma and space.
Example beginning:
```bash
00, 01, 02, 03, ...
```
	- Task requirements
		- Correct formatting with leading zeros
		- No trailing comma
		- Exact spacing
		- The last number should be followed by a new line
		- We can only use **no more** than 2 `print` functions with string format
		- We can only use **one loop** in our code
		- We are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable

- [`print_comb3.py`](./print_comb3.py): Prints all unique combinations of two different digits from 0 to 9
	- Task requirements
		- Digits must be different
		- Combinations must be printed in scending order.(Print only the smallest combination of two digits)
		- Format: `01, 02, 03, ..., 89` (Numbers must be separated by `,` followed by a space)
		- No repetion ("01" and "10" are the same combination of digits)
		- We can only use no more than 3 `print` functions with string format
		- We can only use no more than 2 loops in our code
